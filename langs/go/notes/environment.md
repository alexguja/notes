## Setting up the Go environment
To install Go on MacOS, use the following `brew` command

```sh
brew install go
```

Verify the installation by checking the Go version:

```sh
go version 
# go version go1.24.2 darwin/arm64 ðŸ‘ˆ example output
```

### Workspace
On macOS, your Go projects can live anywhere. The Go Workspace (`$HOME/go` by default) is mainly for third-party Go tools you install with go install.
This workspace has:

```sh
$HOME/go/src #tool source code
$HOME/go/bin #compiled tool binaries
```
To make installed tools runnable from your command line, add the lines below to `~/.profile` (for bash) or `~/.zshrc` (for zsh):

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Apply changes using `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`
